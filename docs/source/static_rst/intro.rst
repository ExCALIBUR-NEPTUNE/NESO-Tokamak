NESO-Tokamak
============


NESO-Tokamak is a fluid-particle hybrid code for modelling the edge region of tokamaks.
The fluid functionality is provided by the Nektar++ finite element framework, while the particle functionality is provided by NESO-Particles.
Coupling between the two is provided by the NESO library.
Additionally, the VANTAGE library can be used to extend the particle functionality to model reactions
